# Applications

Box Developer Console allows you to create applications
you can then use to integrate with Box.
My Apps view displays a list of already created applications
and gives you quick access to their configuration details
and additional options. This way, you don't need to open
the app each time you want to generate
a Developer Token or copy the Client ID.
