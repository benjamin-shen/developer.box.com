# Limitations

## One webhook per item

There's a limit of one webhook per item (file or folder) per application per
authenticated user.

Once a webhook is attached to an item, no second webhook can be attached even if
the second webhook would respond to a different trigger event.

For example, let's assume a webhook is set up by `John Doe` to watch
`FILE.UPLOADED` events in a folder with the name `Junk` for an application 
named `CleanupApp`. At that point, no second webhook can
be added to the `Junk` folder by the `CleanupApp` by `John Doe`, even if it
is to trigger for a `FILE.DOWNLOADED` event.

To listen to another event, [update][update] the existing webhook or create a
new application.

## 1000 webhooks per application, per user

There is a limit of 1000 webhooks per application, per user.

To create more webhooks for a user, create another application or
[update existing webhooks][update] to apply to higher levels in the folder tree.

## Notification URL restrictions

The notification URL, or `address` for a webhook must be a valid HTTPS URL that
resolves to a valid IP address. In addition, it should have a certificate signed
by a reputable certificate authority, as Box does not support self-signed SSL
certificates.

The IP address of the server must be publicly accessible from the internet and
cannot be a `(*.)box.com` address. The port used in the URL must be the
standard HTTPS port (`443`). Notifications will not be delivered to other ports.

## No webhooks on root folder

V2 webhooks cannot be created on the root folder, which is the folder with ID
`0`. Instead, you will need to leverage a [v1 webhook][v1].

<Message type='notice'>
  When the permissions on an item prevent an action from occurring,
  no notification is sent for the attempted action.
</Message>

## Reasons for webhook deletion

The following reasons can cause webhooks to be deleted.

1. Deleting a Box application automatically deletes all webhooks associated with
   the application.
2. Deleting all active Access Tokens associated with a webhook will
   automatically delete the webhook. This includes Developer Tokens and password
3. If the last successful delivery was 30 days ago and the period between the
   last successful delivery date and the last trigger date was more than 14
   days, the webhook will be automatically deleted.

In all of these cases Box would send a webhook payload with the
`WEBHOOK.DELETED` event name to the notification URL. The body of the payload
will include the following additional information.

```json
"additional_info": {
  "reason": "auto_cleanup"
}
