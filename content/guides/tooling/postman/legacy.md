# Legacy Postman Collection

<Message type='danger'>
  We are aware of the issue related to importing the collection into Postman,
  and are working on a fix. In the meantime, please make sure to download
  and use [version 8][v8] of the desktop application. 
</Message>

Clicking the following button will install our [legacy Postman][legacy]
collection. It is an incomplete Postman collection and is not expected to get
any more updates, yet has some features that are (for now) still missing
from the new collection.
