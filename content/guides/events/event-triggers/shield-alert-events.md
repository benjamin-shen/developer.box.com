# Shield Alert Events

[Box Shield][box-shield] must be purchased and enabled on a Box enterprise in
order to take advantage of the advanced security offerings outlined below. 

## Threat detection alerts

Shield [threat detection][threatdetect] delivers context-rich alerts on
potential threats, such as compromised accounts and data theft, based on
anomalous user behavior.

The possible alerts produced by Shield are for:

1. Suspicious locations
1. Suspicious sessions
1. Anomalous downloads
1. Malicious content

All Shield threat detection alert events are produced within the
[enterprise event][events] stream. These events follow the
standard event object schema and the `event_type` value is set to
`SHIELD_ALERT`.

```js
{
  "source":null,
  "created_by":{
    "type":"user",
    "id":"2",
    "name":"Unknown User",
    "login":""
  },
  "action_by":null,
  "created_at":"2019-12-20T11:38:56-08:00",
  "event_id":"97f1b31f-f143-4777-81f8-1b557b39ca33",
  "event_type":"SHIELD_ALERT",
  "ip_address":"10.1.2.3",
  "type":"event",
  "session_id":null,
  "additional_details":{
    "..."
  }
}
```

Information about the specific type of shield alert that triggered the event
will be supplied within the `additional_details` object.

### Suspicious locations alert

<!--alex ignore-->

A suspicious locations alert is produced when when Shield detects a user
accessing content from an unusual, excluded geographic location, or 'host' IP
address. It can be identified by the `Suspicious Locations` value
within `additional_details.shield_alert.rule_category`.

<!--alex enable-->

The `additional_details` payload will provide the following details:

```js
"additional_details":{
  "shield_alert":{
    "rule_category":"Suspicious Locations",
    "rule_id":123,
    "rule_name":"Suspicious Location",
    "risk_score":60,
    "alert_summary":{
      "alert_activities":[
        {
          "occurred_at":"2019-12-20T11:37:05-08:00",
          "event_type":"Download",

    "created_at":"2019-12-20T11:37:15-08:00"
  }
}
```

### Suspicious sessions alert

A suspicious sessions alert is produced when Shield detects a user accessing
content in a session characterized by unusual user-agent strings, unusual IDs,
uncommon types of applications, new IP addresses, and an improbably rapid change
in the person's log-in location. It can be identified by the `Suspicious
Sessions` value within `additional_details.shield_alert.rule_category`.

The `additional_details` payload will provide the following details:

## Information barrier

Information barrier prevents exchanges or
communication that could lead to conflicts of interest
or potential legal issues.
For example, admins can use information barrier
to separate teams based on projects to prevent collaboration on
content restricted to specific groups.

### Events triggered when setting up information barrier

Configuring information barrier produces
events in the [enterprise event][events] stream. For example,
activating or deactivating the barrier triggers an event.

These events follow
the standard event object schema with the `event_type` value
set to one of the following:

* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ENABLED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_PENDING`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_DISABLED`

For example:

```js
{
   "chunk_size": 1,
   "next_stream_position": "1152923169537420243",
   "entries": [
       {
           "source": {
               "barrier_id": 343256,
               "barrier_status": "ENABLED",
               "barrier_segments": [
                   {
                       "name": "8",
                       "member_count": 1
                   },
                   {
                       "name": "9",
                       "member_count": 1
                   }
               ]
           },
           "created_by": {
               "type": "user",
               "id": "16335351460",
               "name": "Ming Demo 3",
               "login": "mfeng+demo4@boxdemo.com"
           },
           "action_by": null,
           "created_at": "2022-10-04T17:42:53-07:00",
           "event_id": "77f9118e-17b6-4d61-842b-24db46ce83b2",
           "event_type": "SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ENABLED",
           "ip_address": "Unknown IP",
           "type": "event",
           "session_id": null,
           "additional_details": null
       }
   ]
}
```

#### Shield information barrier enabled

A `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ENABLED` event is triggered when
the information barrier is enabled for a file or folder.
The `additional_details` payload provides details about the number of
user segments and the number of users affected by the barrier.

```js
"additional_details": {
  "shield_information_barrier": {
     "id": 123,
     "status": "ENABLED",
     "segments": [
        {
          "name": "segment 1",
          "member_count": 6
        },
        {
          "name": "segment 2",
          "member_count": 10
        }
      ]
    }
}
```

#### Shield information barrier pending

A `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_PENDING` event is triggered
when the information barrier is not yet enabled
for a particular file or folder. The activation process
was triggered, but the information barrier is not yet
in place.
The `additional_details` payload provides details about the number of
user segments and the number of users affected by the barrier.

```js
"additional_details": {
   "shield_information_barrier": {
    "id": 123,
    "status": "PENDING",
    "segments": [
        {
          "name": "segment 1",
          "member_count": 6
        },
        {
          "name": "segment 2",
          "member_count": 10
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

#### Shield information barrier deactivated

A `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_DISABLED` event is triggered when
the information barrier is deactivated
for a particular file or folder.
The `additional_details` payload provides details about the number of
user segments and the number of users affected by the barrier.

```js
"additional_details": {
    "shield_information_barrier": {
      "id": 123,
      "status": "DISABLED",
      "segments": [
        { "name": "segment 1", "member_count": 6 },
        { "name": "segment 2", "member_count": 10 }
      ]
    }
  }
```

### Events triggered by performing restricted actions

When the information barrier is set up,
each user attempt to perform restricted actions
or access restricted data
also results in events. These events follow
the standard event object schema with the `event_type` value
set to one of the following:

* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_GROUP_ADD_USER_BLOCKED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_COLLAB_BLOCKED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ITEM_OWNER_TRANSFER_BLOCKED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_SHARED_ITEM_ACCESS_BLOCKED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ITEM_MOVE_BLOCKED`
* `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_ITEM_COPY_BLOCKED`

For example:

```js
       {
           "source": {
               "folder_id": "175972618751",
               "folder_name": "ib test",
               "user_id": "20723635231",

                   "name": "All Files",
                   "id": "0"
               },
               "owned_by": {
                   "type": "user",
                   "id": "20723193902",

                   "login": "mfeng+staging+managed8@boxdemo.com"
               }
           },
           "created_by": {

           "ip_address": "Unknown IP",
           "type": "event",
           "session_id": null,
           "additional_details": {
               "type": "box://event/additional_details/collaboration",

               "is_performed_by_admin": false
           }
       }

```

#### Adding user blocked

restricted groups:

```js
"additional_details": {
    "group_id": "10153686094",
    "group_name": "sample_group"
}
```

#### Collaboration blocked

A `SHIELD_INFORMATION_BARRIER_COLLAB_BLOCKED` event is triggered
