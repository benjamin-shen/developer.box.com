# Box AI

<Message type="notice>
This document is rendered for test purposes and contains content that
will change.

</Message>

The Box AI API extends Box AI to use in your custom
applications. For example, you can use Box AI Q&A
functionality in your third party integration,
or generate content right in
your productâ€™s content editor.

The API is built with ease of use in mind.
Call the API, provide your
document(s) or content, and
provide your prompt. 

## Capabilities

Box AI API provides a number of capabilities
designed to help you build LLM into
your customer applications work flows.
You can build Q&A, generate text, and
even provide a Metadata template and ask Box AI
to suggest values. All within
the Box Platform you are already using for your
other content integrations.

### Q&A

Think of Q&A as a chatbot. Provide the
Box file ID(s) of the content you want
to interact with, provide a prompt, and
ask the Large Language Model (LLM). 

### Text Generation

Much like the functionality Box AI provides
inside of Notes, generate text with
the power of LLM. You must still provide
a Box file ID and a prompt.
