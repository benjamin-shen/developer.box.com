# Using PowerShell Scripts with the Box CLI

By itself, the CLI is already powerful, but using it alongside a PowerShell
script lets you complete repetitive tasks even quicker. We created an example
[scripts][scripts] folder within our CLI GitHub repository to help
jump start your development.

To show you how CLI scripts work, we are going to use the
provision and create users [script][script-1]
template.

This script uses the Box CLI to build and create an
onboarding folder structure, create managed users in bulk, 
and provision such new users by adding them to the newly created 
folder structure as collaborators with viewer or uploader roles.

<Message type=warning>
   This part of the quick start for service accounts 
   and users with administrative privileges only. 
   Skip this step if you are not a Box administrator
   or you do not use a service account.

## Use case

To automatically create users and folder structure, the script
performs the following steps:

1. Uses a `.csv` file to load employee data in bulk.
2. Defines folder structure using a JSON file or uploads
the structure from the user's local directory. 
3. Creates a managed user a predetermined folder structure to each user.

## Prerequisites

### Windows

Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### MacOS & Linux

Install [PowerShell][pwsh]

<message>
If you encounter issues make sure you installed both 
[dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and 
[PowerShell][pwsh]
</message>

### Configured Box application

You should have a Box application created.
If you haven't done so yet, see [step 1][Step 1] of this quick start guide.
Alternatively, go to your [developer console][console], and follow the guide 
[Setup with OAuth 2.0][auth].

## Download the script

Clone the script to a directory of your choice
and navigate to that directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git box-cli
cd box-cli/examples/User\ Creation\ \&\ Provisioning/
```

## Configure the script settings

Adapt the script to run in your own environment.
In this example, you will use the sample data provided
with the script.

### Prepare the user list

You can use the following sample files to load users:
`Employees_1.csv`, `Employees_5.csv`, and `Employees_10.csv`. 
Each will load 1, 5 or 10 new users.

Customize these files for a test run. For example, update the 
`Employees_1.csv` with the following data:

```bash
firstName,lastName,email
Isaac,Newton,abc@abc.local
```

In the `Users_Create_Provision.ps1` script file, specify which `.csv` 
file you would like to load.

```bash
#Set Employee List CSV Path
$EmployeeList = "./Employees_1.csv"
```

### Create folder structure

You can either create a folder structure from a JSON 
file or upload it from your local drive.

#### Use a JSON file

The `Folder_Structure.json` file contains the folder structure you want to create.
As an example you will create a `Market Research` and a `Sales Plays` 
folder, each with a subfolder `Statistics` and `Big Pharma` respectively.
The script will place this folder structure
under the `Onboarding` folder.

```bash
#First create Onboarding folder owned by current user
$script:OnboardingFolderId = box folders:create 0 "Onboarding" --id-only 
Write-Output "Created a user owned Onboarding folder with id: $($OnboardingFolderId)"
```

Provide the location of the `Folder_Structure.json` file.

```bash
#Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly
# upload a local folder
$FolderStructureJSONPath = "./Folder_Structure.json"
#$LocalUploadPath = "./OnboardingLocalUpload"
```

#### Upload file from local drive

You can also upload a folder structure directly 
from the local file system:

1. Set the path to your local folder:

    ```bash
    #Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly
    # upload a local folder
    #$FolderStructureJSONPath = "./Folder_Structure.json"
    $LocalUploadPath = "./OnboardingLocalUpload"
    ```

2. Comment the `New-Folder-Structure` call, and uncomment the next section:

    ```bash
    #Create Folder Structure from JSON
    #New-Folder-Structure

    #OR directly upload Folder structure to current user's root folder
    # from local directory

    $script:OnboardingFolderId = box folders:upload $LocalUploadPath --id-only
    Write-Output "Uploaded local folder structre to current user's root folder 
    with $($script:OnboardingFolderId)"
    ```

## Run the script

1. Change the directory to the folder containing the script. 
    In this example, it is the `User Creation & Provisioning` 
    folder.

    ```bash
    rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning$ pwsh
    PowerShell 7.2.4
    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

    https://aka.ms/powershell
    Type 'help' to get help.

    /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning>
    ```

2. Run the script:

    ```bash
    PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning> ./Users_Create_Provision.ps1
    ```

    The response will be similar to the following:

    ```bash
    Starting User Creation & Provisioning script...
