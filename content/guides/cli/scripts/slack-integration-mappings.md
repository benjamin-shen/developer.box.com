# Manage Slack integration folder mappings

This script helps manage the folder mappings between Slack and Box if using Box
as the content store for Slack. It creates a list of current Slack channel and
Box folder mappings and can create or update mappings based on input csv. This
script will maintain all permissions.

For details, checkout the [Github repo][1].
