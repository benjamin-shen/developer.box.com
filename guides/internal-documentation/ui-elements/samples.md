# Samples

Samples represent a set of sample code blocks extracted from the CLI, SDK, and
cURL repositories. These code samples are automatically extracted from the
various markdown files in these repositories.

## IDs

Samples are specified by using the ID of the endpoint.

```html
<Samples id='get_files_id'></Samples>
```

<H>

<Samples id='get_files_id'/>

</H>

## Variants

By default the `default` variant is selected for a sample. For some samples
different variations exist. They can be specified by passing a `variant` name in.

```html
<Samples id='post_folders_id_copy' variant='with_name' ></Samples>
```

<H>

<Samples id='post_folders_id_copy' variant='with_name' />
