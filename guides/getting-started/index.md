# Getting Started

Our documentation is divided into five main sections:

- **Learn Box Platform**: A getting started walk through of all things Platform
- **Developer Guides**: Information about endpoint usage not covered by
reference documentation
- **API Reference**: Endpoint documentation
- **SDK and Tools**: Information about official Box SDKs and tooling
- **Sample Code Catalog**: Consolidated list of several code repositories

If you are new to development with the Box API, we recommend following the
pages in the [Learn Box Platform][learn] section to get started.

If you have questions, checkout our [forum][forum-link].
