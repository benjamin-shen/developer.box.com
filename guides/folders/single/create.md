# Create Folder

To create a folder in Box you will need to provide our API with a `name` for the
new folder, as well as the `id` of the `parent` folder that you would like to
create the new folder within.

# Name restrictions

There are some restrictions to the folder name. Names containing non-printable
ASCII characters, forward and backward slashes (`/`, `\`), as well as names
with trailing spaces are prohibited.

Additionally, the names `.` and `..` are reserved names and therefore
also prohibited.
