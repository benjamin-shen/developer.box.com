# Get Folder Lock

To get a list of the current locks on a folder in Box, call the
`GET /folder_locks/` API with the id of the folder supplied as a `folder_id`
query string parameter.

## Folder ID

The `id` of any folder can be determined by visiting a folder in the web
application and copying the `id` from the URL. For example, for the URL
`https://*.app.box.com/folder/123` the `folder_id` is `123`.
