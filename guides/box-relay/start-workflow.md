# Start Workflow

The [start workflow endpoint][start] can be used to start a flow within a
workflow of type `WORKFLOW_MANUAL_START`. Other flow types cannot be started.
If you have the flow set up to accept configurations at runtime, you must send
in the optional `outcomes` array object.

<Message type='notice'>

For more information on how to use this endpoint, refer to our [blog][blog]
post.
