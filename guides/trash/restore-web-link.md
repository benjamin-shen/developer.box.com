# Restore Web Link

To restore a web link that has been moved to the trash, but has not yet been
purged, make a `POST` request to the `/web_links/:web_link_id` endpoint. This
will place the web link in the original parent folder if it is still
available, you optionally can specify a `parent` folder.
