# Box AI

<Message type="notice">

Box AI API is a beta feature, which means the
available capabilities may change.
Box AI API is available to all **Enterprise Plus** customers.

</Message>

Box AI API allows you to use Box AI
functionality
in your custom applications. For example, you can
implement Box AI question and answer
functionality in your third party integration
or generate content right in
your productâ€™s content editor.

## Box AI capabilities

Box AI API provides a number of capabilities
designed to help you leverage Large Language Models (LLMs)
in your application workflows.

Currently, you can ask Box AI to answer
user questions, summarize the document content,
or generate text you can use in your documents.
You can also use the Box AI UI element in Content Preview
to embed AI functionality in your apps.

### Asking questions

You can interact with Box AI to ask questions about
the stored content, for example, while working
on documents you keep in Box.

Box AI can answer your questions about the
content or generate a summary based on the
file you supply.

Read [Box AI for documents][boxaidocs]
to see how users can interact with Box AI while
working on their files.

### Generating text

You can use Box AI to generate text
based on provided content.
For example, you can ask Box AI to create a template
or an email based on an article you supply.

Box Notes uses Box AI to generate text
and refine the already existing note content.
For details, see [Box AI for Notes][boxainotes].

### Embedded Box AI UI Element

The Box AI element available in Content Preview
allows asking questions about documents directly
within custom applications.

Check out how to use the [Box Preview UI Element][boxaielement]
to embed Box AI functionality in your projects.

## Supported languages

Box AI works in a number of languages including
English, Japanese, French, Spanish, and many more.
However, the underlying models are primarily
trained on English language documents. This means
that prompts in other languages may return answers
of lower quality than in English. Tests have shown
satisfactory results for summarizing, checking grammar
and spelling, and answering questions, but bear in mind
that the results may be different than in English.
