# Getting started with Box AI

## What is Box AI

The Box AI API extends the power of Box AI to your
custom applications. Imagine the Box AI for Documents
functionality built into your third party integration,
or the ability to generate content like you can in Box Notes,
right in your productâ€™s content editor. The Box AI API
benefits from the same enterprise-grade security, privacy,
and compliance posture as Box AI. As long as your
content is already in Box, you can leverage the API
to tap into that content in 3rd party and custom apps
with peace of mind.

To use Box AI, call the `Ask` endpoint, provide
your document(s), and ask any question.
You can also use this endpoint to generate text on the fly.
