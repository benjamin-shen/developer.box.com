# Create Comment

To create a comment, call the [`POST /comments`][post_comments] API with the
message of the comment, as well as the ID of the file to leave the comment on.

A comment's message can also mentions users using the `@` sign. To do so, add
the string `@[userid:name]` anywhere within the message. The `user_id` is the
target user's ID, where the `name` can be any custom phrase. In the Box UI this
name will link to the user's profile.

Then, pass this string as the `tagged_message` instead of the `message`.
