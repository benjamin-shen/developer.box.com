# Use Cases

Before beginning application development, it is best to assess if your use
case is a good fit for the Box Platform. Generally speaking, content centric
processes perform best.

Some questions to ask when assessing if a use case include:

- Is content always involved in the process?
- Does the process involve moving content from one place to another? 
- Can the workflow abide by [waterfall permissions][waterfall]?
- Does the process involve administrative tasks that may be automated?

If you answered **yes** to the above questions, you most likely have a great use
case for Box Platform. 

Some common customer solutions include: 

- Marketing asset management
- Secure document vaults
- Wealth management portals
- Automatic folder creation based on user provisioning
- Adding relevant metadata using machine learning 
- Claim reviews with built-in approval/rejection flows
- Event monitoring for security and auditing

Still not sure if you have a good use case? Reach out to your Box account team.
