The Box Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for making requests to Box APIs
from your terminal window or command prompt. It takes less than five minutes
to set up and provides you direct access to the API. We also offer a suite of
[sample scripts][samples] to jump start any administration automation tasks.
