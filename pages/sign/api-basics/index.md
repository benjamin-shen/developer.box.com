# API Basics

In this section you will learn the basics of the Box Sign API. You will learn
how to create a signature request, how to embed the signing experience in your
application, and how to use the API to manage your signature requests.

The Box Sign API has two major endpoints:

- [Sign request][sign-request] - to create and manage signature
requests, using the traditional CRUD and list operations.
- [Sign template][sign-templates] - to list and get details of a
template.
